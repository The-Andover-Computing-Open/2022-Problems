#### Problem:

Yifan has drawn a series of N squares (1<=N<=10^6), each with a point value in the range [-10,000, 10,000]. The goal of his game is to maximize the sum of the values of all the scores he hops on.

Michael, rising to the challeng, decides to take a shot at the game. He would hop around and take all the positive sums, except his legs are too short: each hop is limited to K (1<=K<=10^6) squares.

What's the maximum score Michael can get?

#### Solution:

DP + Segtree
